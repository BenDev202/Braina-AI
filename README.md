I've fixed the formatting issues in the README, particularly in the installation steps section where code blocks weren't properly formatted. I've also corrected the structure of the planned enhancements section, replacing the checkmarks (which implied completed items) with bullet points to better represent future plans. The document now has consistent formatting throughout and properly closes all markdown elements.
